# dlmac

macOS CLI wrapper for [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) and [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org). Download online media and extract audio from local video files.

## Requirements

- macOS
- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh)
- yt-dlp
- ffmpeg

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/srmdn/dlmac.git
cd dlmac
./install.sh
```

`install.sh` checks dependencies and offers to install missing ones via Homebrew.

## Usage

```
dlmac info <url>                    Show video metadata
dlmac formats <url>                 Show available formats
dlmac video <url>                   Download best video (mp4)
dlmac video <url> --quality 360p    Download best video up to 360p
dlmac video <url> --quality 480p    Download best video up to 480p
dlmac video <url> --quality 720p    Download best video up to 720p
dlmac video <url> --quality 1080p   Download best video up to 1080p
dlmac audio <url>                   Download best audio (mp3)
dlmac audio <url> --format mp3      Download audio as mp3
dlmac audio <url> --format m4a      Download audio as m4a
dlmac audio <url> --format wav      Download audio as wav
dlmac convert <file> --to mp3       Extract audio from video to mp3
dlmac convert <file> --to m4a       Extract audio from video to m4a
dlmac convert <file> --to wav       Extract audio from video to wav
```

All downloads saved to `./downloads/`.

## Examples

```bash
# Get video info
./dlmac info "https://example.com/video"

# Download video at 720p
./dlmac video "https://example.com/video" --quality 720p

# Download audio as mp3
./dlmac audio "https://example.com/video" --format mp3

# Extract audio from local video
./dlmac convert myvideo.mp4 --to mp3
```

## Compatibility

**Video downloads produce H.264 video with AAC audio in an MP4 container.**
This is the format QuickTime, Safari, and Apple's media framework expect.

If the source offers H.264+AAC natively, dlmac downloads it directly with
zero re-encoding — fast and lossless. If H.264+AAC is unavailable, dlmac
automatically re-encodes the output with ffmpeg.

Players like VLC, IINA, and mpv can play any codec combination. The H.264+AAC
preference only matters for QuickTime and Apple apps.

## Troubleshooting

**QuickTime can't open the file**
The output is already H.264+AAC and should work with QuickTime. If you
still have issues, check that ffmpeg is installed (`brew install ffmpeg`)
and that your yt-dlp is up to date (`brew upgrade yt-dlp`).

**No H.264 formats available**
Some videos (particularly at 1080p and above) only offer VP9/AV1 video.
dlmac falls back to whatever is available and re-encodes automatically.
You'll see a "Re-encoding to H.264+AAC" message during download.

**"Re-encoding to H.264+AAC" message appears**
This is normal when the source doesn't provide H.264+AAC natively.
The download will take longer because ffmpeg must re-encode the entire
video. The result is still a QuickTime-compatible MP4.

## Limitations

- macOS only
- No playlist support
- No interactive format selector
- No login/cookie support
- Quality depends on source video availability; falls back to best available
  below the requested resolution

## Legal & Ethical Notice

dlmac is a general-purpose media downloader built on yt-dlp. It does not
discriminate by platform — any URL yt-dlp supports will work. However, not
all platforms permit downloading.

**You are responsible for**:
- Ensuring you have the right to download the content
- Checking each platform's terms of service before downloading
- Respecting copyright, licensing, and applicable laws in your jurisdiction

**What dlmac does NOT do**:
- Bypass DRM, paywalls, or access restrictions
- Store or transmit login credentials (no cookie/auth support)
- Access private, unlisted, or members-only content
- Circumvent platform rate limits or anti-bot measures

**Platform policies vary.** YouTube generally permits personal-use downloads
in many jurisdictions. Instagram, X (Twitter), and TikTok explicitly prohibit
unauthorized downloading in their terms. dlmac does not encourage violating
any platform's policies — it simply passes your URL to yt-dlp. The choice
of what to download is yours, and so is the responsibility.

If you are unsure whether downloading specific content is legal in your
country or permitted by the platform, consult a legal professional.
